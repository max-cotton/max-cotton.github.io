			<ul>
				<li>Learned and implemented the theory of Artificial Neural Networks using Python with NumPy, without the use of any 3rd party machine learning libraries.</li>
				<li>I also allowed for training and saving of multiple models with custom hyper-parameters via a GUI, as well as experimenting via Jupyter notebooks, and achieved a prediction accuracy of 96% on the MNIST dataset.</li>
				<li>Provided a Docker file and set up a GitHub workflow to run unit tests as part of the CI/CD.</li>
